Beyond my academic and research pursuits, I maintain a balanced lifestyle through various extracurricular activities. These hobbies not only help me recharge but also develop skills like discipline, teamwork, and adaptability, which complement my work in mechanics and engineering. Below is a selection of my interests and experiences.

## Dancing
- **Description**: I am passionate about Latin dance and breaking (breakdancing), which I have pursued actively during my university years. These styles emphasize coordination, creativity, and physical expression.  
- **Experiences**: Served as the Breaking Department Head of the Nova Street Dance Club at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech); member of the SUSTech International Standard Dance Team and the Tsinghua University International Standard Dance Team. Achieved first prize and third prize in group dance at the Guangdong Province Line Dance Competition.  

## Fitness
- **Description**: I have maintained a consistent fitness routine since my sophomore year, training nearly five days a week with a focus on strength, cardio, and overall health.  
- **Experiences**: My personal records in the "big three" lifts are bench press at 90 kg, deadlift at 117.5 kg, and squat at 97.5 kg(My weight~ 63 Kg). I keep my body fat percentage below 15% year-round. In addition to strength training, I incorporate aerobic activities like running (a 10 km run weekly at a pace of 6 min/km) and swimming regularly. These exercises have built a strong physique, providing me with sustained energy and vitality for daily studies and research. The discipline required mirrors the perseverance needed in long-term experiments and problem-solving.

## Skiing 
- **Description**: I enjoy snowboarding (single-board skiing) as a thrilling winter sport that combines adventure with technical skill.
