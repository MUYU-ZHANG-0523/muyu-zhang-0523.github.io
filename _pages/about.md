Muyu Zhang is a Master's student in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the [Department of Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.sustech.edu.cn/), Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/)), expected to graduate in 2026. I hold a Bachelor's degree in the same field from SUSTech (2019-2023) and completed an exchange program at Tsinghua University Shenzhen International Graduate School([Tsinghua SIGS](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)) (2023-2024), where I studied Advanced Electron Microscopy. My research focuses on nanoscale materials mechanics, thermo-mechanical coupling deformations, and soft smart materials development. I have contributed to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Major Program on high-performance manufacturing for optical components, with hands-on experience in projects like thermally-assisted nanoscratching of silicon, fused silica densification characterization using NBED, and hydrogel microsphere synthesis. 

My strengths include extensive experimental skills (proficient in TEM, FIB-SEM, nanoindentation, and tribometry), simulation expertise (ANSYS, COMSOL, ABAQUS, LAMMPS), and teaching experience (served as TA for 3 courses, guiding student projects on metamaterial design and additive manufacturing). I also gained practical engineering insights from an internship at China Aero Engine Research Institute, designing combustor components using finite element analysis. These experiences have honed my rigorous research approach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and problem-solving abilities. Currently, I am seeking PhD opportunities in mechanics, materials science, or related fieldsâ€”please feel free to contact me for discussions or recommendations.
