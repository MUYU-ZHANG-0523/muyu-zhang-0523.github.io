# Research Interests

As a Master's student in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), my research focuses on the mechanics of materials at the nanoscale, including thermo-mechanical coupling in semiconductors, densification behaviors in amorphous materials, and the development of soft smart materials for advanced manufacturing and optical applications. I am particularly interested in cross-scale manufacturing mechanics, where I combine experimental techniques (e.g., nanoscratching, TEM/NBED) with simulations to optimize material performance under extreme conditions. My work contributes to high-performance optical components and sustainable manufacturing processes, supported by projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC).

Below is a summary of my key research projects, publications, and patents.

### Thermal-Ultrasonic Coupled Nanoscratching of Monocrystalline Silicon (May 2025 - Present)
![Thermal-Ultrasonic Device Schematic](/assets/img/thermal-ultrasonic-svg.svg)  
- **Advisor**: Chair Prof. Liangchi Zhang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Cross-scale Manufacturing Mechanics, SUSTech  
- **Description**: Building on molecular dynamics simulations by other group members, which revealed that ultrasonic vibration assistance can suppress dislocation generation during monocrystalline silicon processing, and our prior studies showing that high temperatures reduce amorphization phase transformations in silicon machining, this project aims to combine thermal and ultrasonic methods to minimize defects in silicon processing. Ultrasonic vibrations (amplitude <100 nm, frequency ∼100 kHz) are applied in both contact normal (vertical) and scratching (tangential) directions to evaluate thermo-mechanical-vibrational coupling effects.  
- **Contributions**: Experimental findings indicate that applying ultrasonic vibration in the vertical direction, due to excessive loading, detrimentally affects silicon processing quality regardless of temperature. The next research objective is to explore tangential direction coupling for ultrasonic-assisted processing to achieve better defect reduction. I contributed to the design of the experimental setup, as well as the experiments and analyses. Using customized piezoelectric ceramics to generate high-frequency vibrations, with ANSYS simulations for optimizing resonance frequency, indenter counterweight, indenter geometry, stiffness, and high-temperature tolerance of the overall setup. Additionally, by adjusting indenter clamping loads, we regulated impedance to ensure stable vibration frequencies. 
- **Methods**: High-temperature tribometry and subsurface analysis via TEM/FIB-SEM.  
- **Status**: Ongoing; preliminary results show potential for enhanced machining efficiency and reduced subsurface damage through optimized tangential vibrations.  

### Stress-Corrosion Behavior of Silicon in Chemical Environments (May 2025 - Present)
![Stress-Corrosion Fracture Diagram](/assets/img/stress-corrosion-svg.svg)  
- **Advisor**: Chair Prof. Liangchi Zhang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Cross-scale Manufacturing Mechanics, SUSTech  
- **Description**: This project investigates the stress-corrosion mechanisms in monocrystalline silicon, inspired by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes where hydrogen peroxide reacts with silicon in alkaline environments, softening the material to reduce damage and enhance polishing efficiency. Drawing from literature on glass materials (silicon dioxide) fracturing in water, which exhibits three distinct stages—(1) chemical reaction-dominated fracture where crack velocity increases with load, (2) a plateau phase where reaction rate matches crack velocity, and (3) stress-dominated fracture with renewed velocity increase and differing slopes between stages 1 and 3—I hypothesize that silicon may exhibit a similar plateau phase (stage 2). In CMP, if polishing velocity exceeds reaction velocity, added chemical agents may not play a dominant role; however, increasing temperature could accelerate chemical reactions, thereby improving polishing efficiency.  
- **Contributions**: Identifying potential plateau stage in silicon's chemical corrosion fracture to optimize CMP parameters. 
- **Methods**: Initial attempts used Vickers indenter discrete methods to measure fracture velocity, but data exhibited high errors and failed to capture high/low velocity regimes. Currently building a three-point bending experimental setup in chemical environments, employing indentation methods to initiate dynamic crack tips on 200-micron-thick silicon wafers for precise measurements.  
- **Status**: Ongoing; focusing on experimental validation of the plateau hypothesis and temperature effects on reaction rates.


## Past Projects

### Nanoscale Characterization of Fused Silica Densification Using NBED (Sept 2024 - Apr 2025)
![Fused Silica Densification Map](/assets/img/fused-silica-svg.svg)  
- **Advisor**: Chair Prof. Liangchi Zhang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Cross-scale Manufacturing Mechanics, SUSTech  
- **Description**: Fused silica, a key material in controlled nuclear fusion optical devices, often suffers from crack damage under high-energy flux due to processing defects. Prior studies have identified that plastic deformation and defects during precision machining primarily stem from densification in micro- and nanoscale structures under high stress. However, limitations in measurement techniques have prevented accurate mapping of densification distributions, forcing reliance on molecular dynamics simulations for constitutive relations in finite element modeling of fused silica polishing. Inspired by the Debye scattering equation from solid-state physics textbooks for inverting reduced density distributions, combined with nano-beam electron diffraction (NBED) capable of focusing beam spots to ~1 nm, this project develops a method to invert the densification distribution in fused silica post-loading. Through experiments, we achieved the first accurate mapping of stress-induced densification, revealing that the densification distribution aligns with von Mises stress patterns, with uniform densification occurring without further yielding, indicating ideal elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. This enabled the derivation of the material's constitutive relations.  
- **Contributions**: Advanced mechanistic understanding of glass deformation under extreme conditions by constructing a temperature-dependent constitutive model that captures densification-induced plasticity. Key findings include a nearly constant density in the plastic zone, a sharp density gradient at the elastic-plastic boundary, linear decreases in yield stress and hardness with temperature, and an unusual increase in elastic modulus (combining thermal softening and stiffening). This provides a predictive framework for manufacturing high-integrity oxide glass components.  
- **Methods**: Nano-ramp scratching experiments combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), radial distribution function (RDF) analysis, and NBED for subsurface imaging at ~1 nm resolution. 
- **Outcomes**: Manuscript in preparation for *Nature Communications*, An invention Patent(Under review), offering new insights into nanoscale deformation mechanisms and optimizing ultraprecision machining to minimize subsurface damage.  


### Thermally-Assisted Nanoscratching of Monocrystalline Silicon (Sept 2023 - Apr 2025)
![Silicon Nanoscratching Temperature Curve](/assets/img/thermal-nanoscratching-svg.svg)  
- **Advisor**: Chair Prof. Liangchi Zhang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Cross-scale Manufacturing Mechanics, SUSTech  
- **Description**: Prior studies have shown that high temperatures can induce amorphization followed by recrystallization in monocrystalline silicon. Motivated by this, the project explores whether elevated-temperature processing can reduce defects caused by amorphization phase transformations. Experiments were conducted from room temperature up to 800°C to investigate material removal and subsurface defects under thermo-mechanical coupling.  
- **Contributions**: Identified brittle-to-ductile transition behaviors and determined that 600°C is the optimal temperature, where amorphization dramatically decreases without introducing new defects, leading to minimal subsurface damage. 
- **Methods**: High-temperature nanoscratching (Tribometer Rtec/MFT-5000), cross-sectional analysis via TEM & FIB-SEM, and molecular dynamics.
- **Outcomes**: Manuscript under revision for *Tribology International*.

- **Advisor**: Prof. Canhui Yang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Soft Mechanics & Smart Manufacturing, SUSTech  
- **Description**: This project, undertaken as my undergraduate graduation thesis, aimed to develop a variable-focus Fresnel lens using dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA) to enhance solar energy collection. Fresnel lenses offer advantages in lightness and thinness, making them suitable for concentrating sunlight onto solar panels to reduce material costs. However, a key limitation is that non-direct sunlight causes the focal point to shift away from a single focal plane. To address this, a tunable-focus lens can improve energy efficiency. Leveraging the lightweight nature of Fresnel lenses for greater focal adjustment with minimal energy, combined with the low power consumption of DEA devices, the initial concept was to create a system that assists solar energy harvesting by dynamically adjusting focus.  
- **Contributions**: Designed and validated the initial feasibility of the DEA-driven Fresnel lens system as part of my undergraduate thesis. While time constraints prevented further parameter optimization and simulations, the work demonstrated proof-of-concept for electro-mechanical coupling in soft materials, leading to responsive lens prototypes. This project earned the Excellent Graduation Thesis (Design) Award for Undergraduates at SUSTech..  
- **Methods**: Material synthesis, mechanical testing, and optical characterization of polyelectrolyte elastomers.
- **Outcomes**: Contributed to publication in *Small*.  

### Hydrogel Microsphere Development (Sept 2021 - Jun 2023)
- **Advisor**: Prof. Canhui Yang, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Soft Mechanics & Smart Manufacturing, SUSTech  
- **Description**: This project focused on synthesizing functional hydrogel microparticles using a jet impingement method on a thin plate to generate secondary droplets, producing atomized sodium alginate droplets that solidify upon binding with calcium ions. Particle size was precisely controlled by varying sodium alginate concentration and jet flow rate, resulting in hydrogel particles with diameters in the range of a few microns.  
- **Contributions**: Optimized fabrication parameters to achieve controlled material properties, such as size and responsiveness, demonstrating the method's efficacy for producing uniform microparticles suitable for advanced applications. 
- **Methods**: Chemical synthesis involving jet impingement for droplet formation, calcium ion crosslinking for solidification, and viscosity measurement using rheometer
